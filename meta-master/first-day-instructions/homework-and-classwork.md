# Homework
* Always do the homework for the upcoming day. (i.e. if it's W1D1 tonight I want to do the homework for the upcoming day which is W1D2)
* There is a time estimate for all homework and readings. Students should spend the time allotted on the homework before stopping and checking over any solutions they might have missed.

## Until (and including) W1D3
### Classwork Submission
  * Students can zip their pair programming class work at the end of each day and write an email with the subject line "W1D(whichever day this is)" (SF: instructors-sf@appacademy.io, NYC: instructors-ny@appacademy.io).
### Homework Submission
  * Until students learn git they will be expected to email in a zipped version of their homework at the end of the day.
  * Students can zip their homework but the subject will be for whichever day that homework is for. So if today is W1D2 and I'm doing tonight's homework then the subject will be "HW W1D3 Fname1 Lname1", and that will be emailed to: (SF: instructors-sf@appacademy.io, NYC: instructors-ny@appacademy.io).


## After W1D3 (After Learning Git)
### Classwork Submission:
  * Students will generally have a new pairing partner each day. Together you'll make a folder for this day's work on their local computer and will use `git init` to create a `.git` folder in that top level folder.
  * Students will then use Git to regularly commit your work throughout the day.
  * Partners will each make their own Github repositories.
  * Before the end of the day both partners will push the day's work up to both of their separate Github repositories.
  * Before 6pm students will submit the link for one of their repositories on Progress Tracker (just one will count for both)
### Homework Submission:
  * Students will make a singular homework repository and submit the link for it on Progress Tracker.
  * For each day students will make a folder called WXDY(again for the day it is due)
  * Once a student has spent the allotted homework time they will push up their work.
